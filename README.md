# Custom Script Template Tool
This tool allows you to add custom script templates and create instances of them just like a normal monobehaviour.
As this is still a quick and dirty version I don't garantuee that it works without any issues.
 
## The Tool

The picture above shows how the tool looks like to add new templates.
You can open this window from here: Edit/Script Template Settings.

To add new templates use the "+" button in the top right corner.
The menu hooks are just generated once you click the save button in the top left corner.
This will cause a recompile so check when the project is finished with compilation.

To edit a template click on the edit button in its row.
This will open another window which you can see below:
