# Custom Script Template Tool
 This tool allows you to add custom script templates and create instances of them just like a normal monobehaviour.
 As this is still a quick and dirty version I don't garantuee that it works without any issues.
 
 You can find the list of templates here: Tools/Ikaroon/Script Templates

 The picture above shows how the tool looks like to add new templates.
 You can add new templates using the "Add Template" button.
 The "Clear" button clears the second text area aka the content of the file.
 
 The menu hooks are just generated once you click "Apply".
