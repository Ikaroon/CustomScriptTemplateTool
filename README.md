# Script Templater
This tool allows you to add custom script templates and create instances of them just like a normal monobehaviour.
As this is still a quick and dirty version I don't garantuee that it works without any issues.

## The Tool
![Script Template Settings](https://marian-brinkmann.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GitHub_CustomScriptTemplateTool_Settings.png)

The picture above shows how the tool looks like to add new templates.
You can open this window from here: `Window/General/Script Templater`.

To add new templates use the `+` button in the top right corner.
The menu hooks are just generated once you click the save button in the top left corner.
This will cause a recompile so check when the project is finished with compilation.

To edit a template click on the edit button in its row.
This will open another window which you can see below:
