# Custom Script Template Tool
 This tool allows you to add custom script templates and create instances of them just like a normal monobehaviour.
 As this is still a quick and dirty version I don't garantuee that it works without any issues.
 
 ## The Tool
 ![Template Data View](https://marian-brinkmann.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GitHub_CustomScriptTemplateTool.png)
 The picture above shows how the tool looks like to add new templates.
 You can open this window from here: Tools/Ikaroon/Script Templates.
 
 To add new templates use the "Add Template" button.
 The "Clear" button clears the second text area aka the content of the file.
 
 The menu hooks are just generated once you click "Apply".
 This will cause a recompile so check when the project is finished with compilation.
